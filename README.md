# **Stock Price Sentiment Prediction**

This project explores the relationship between financial sentiment and stock price movements by integrating machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Using historical stock price data from the Yahoo Finance API and financial news headlines from NewsAPI, I aim to assess whether sentiment trends can enhance traditional stock price forecasting. So far, I have collected and cleaned stock price data, retrieved financial news, and implemented basic sentiment analysis using VADER. The next steps include improving sentiment classification with FinBERT, merging sentiment data with stock prices, and applying machine learning models such as LSTM, ARIMA, or Prophet for time-series forecasting. This project is actively being developed, with planned enhancements in deep learning-based sentiment analysis, stock-sentiment correlation analysis, and predictive modeling.
